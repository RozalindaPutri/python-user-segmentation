# User Segmentation Analysis using RFM

📌 **Project Overview**
This project presents a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework based on transaction data from an e-commerce dataset.
The objective is to classify customers into meaningful segments such as Champion, Loyal, At Risk, and Hibernating to support data-driven marketing, retention, and customer relationship strategies**.
The analysis focuses on data cleaning, feature engineering, RFM scoring, and rule-based segmentation using Python only, without any machine learning models.

🎯 **Objectives**
* Segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary behavior
* Identify high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers
* Understand customer distribution across RFM segments
* Support retention, reactivation, and loyalty strategies
* Generate actionable insights for business decision-making

📊 **Key Metrics Analyzed**
* Recency (days since last transaction)
* Frequency (number of transactions per customer)
* Monetary (total transaction value per customer)
* RFM Scores (1–5 scale for each dimension)
* Customer count and percentage per segment

🔍 **Key Insights**
* The **Hibernating** segment is the largest, indicating many customers have been inactive for a long time.
* The **Champion and Loyal** segments represent only about **28%** of customers but contribute the **highest revenue**.
* Almost **half of the customers** fall into critical segments (*Hibernating, At Risk, About to Sleep*), indicating a serious retention challenge.
* The **Potential Loyalists** segment shows strong potential to be developed into loyal and champion customers.

🛠 **Tools Used**
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* Dataset: E-commerce Transaction Dataset (simulated / non-real data)

📂 **Project Deliverables**
* Python notebook for RFM analysis and segmentation
* Cleaned and aggregated customer-level dataset
* RFM scoring and segmentation tables
* Bar chart visualization of customer segments
* Summary insights and business recommendations

📝 **Notes**
* This project focuses on **rule-based RFM segmentation using Python**.
* No machine learning models were used in this analysis.
* The dataset is not real transaction data and is used for **analytical and educational purposes only**.
